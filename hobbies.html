      <h3>Why I Love Cooking</h3>
      <p>
        Cooking is very therapeutic. To me it is also very educational.
        Learning about the different meats, vegetables, starches, fruits, spices
        and how they interact with each other is such a fascinating process to me.
        Different cultures and use the same ingredients in such drastically different ways.
        I love to explore how different food combinations go together.
        Aside from eating, experimenting is the best part of cooking.
        Here are some of my favorite dishes:

      <h3>Video Games I Enjoy</h3>
      <p>With such a busy lifestyle, I don't often get opportunities to play video games.
        But when I do, I love to play sports games, RPG style games, and strategy games.
        Here are some of my favorites:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <p>Madden, Final Fantasy, Star Wars, & Sid Meiers</p>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Sports Are Everything (Almost üòÅ)</h3>
      <p>Enjoying watching sports is my absolute favorite thing to do.
        It's something that I enjoy doing by myself or with a group of friends, at home or at the sporting event.
        There's nothing better than watching a football game, especially the Saints,
        with a po‚Äôboy and fries or hot wings, pizza, and a good beer.</p>
